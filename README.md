# Iris Flower Classification Using SVM

## Project Overview
This project implements an Iris flower classification model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) from the `scikit-learn` library. The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal length and width for three species of Iris flowers. The goal is to classify the species based on these measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data). The dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features each:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (target variable)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```
2. Install the required libraries
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
   ```
   
##Usage
To run the jupyter notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open main.ipynb and run the cells to train the SVM model and visualize the results.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions to enhance the project! Here are some areas where you can contribute:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Implement grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for the SVM model to improve accuracy.

2. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Add cross-validation techniques to provide a more robust estimate of model performance.

3. **Model Comparison:**
   - Implement additional classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, KNN) and compare their performance with the SVM model.

4. **Confusion Matrix Visualization:**
   - Include a visualization of the confusion matrix to better understand the classification performance.

5. **Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Analyze and visualize feature importance to determine which features are most influential in the classification process.

6. **Decision Boundary Visualization:**
   - Add visualization for the decision boundaries of the SVM model to illustrate how the model separates different classes.
